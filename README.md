# Technical Evaluations

This repo is designed as a brain-dump and reference for the myriad of Open and Closed source technologies out there.

I find it hard to keep track of all of them, so I've documented my findings as much as possible in hopes that I don't have to relearn them the next time.

Some of the evaluations include my personal opinions and findings; however, as a developer of 20 years, I completely understand that software development is a hard and complicated beast.  

Unfortunately, I won't be able to compare every nuance, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to compile this list.  However, I am definitely open to listing any major features I might have missed on your favorite technology.
